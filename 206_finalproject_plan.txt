Which option for the final project are you choosing -- 1, 2, or 3?
I am choosing option 2. 

IF YOU ARE CHOOSING OPTION 3, answer the following questions:

* Write 1-3 sentences summarizing what the goal of your project is:


* What are your two data sources? Provide links to documentation or websites you will be getting data from.


* Why are you proposing this project?


* What will the output of this project be? What will it look like, and what information will it contain?


* What are your concerns about this proposal?


-----

THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS ARE FOR EVERYONE. (Though they may be easier if you are choosing Option 1 or 2, because you can reference the Option 1 or 2 instructions.)

* What will at least one of the classes you're going to define be called?
In addition to the Class Movie, I will also be creating the recommended Class Tweet to handle the Twitter data. 


* What will that class take as input to its constructor?
The class Tweet will take the tweet text, the tweet ID, the username of the person who posted the tweet, the name of the movie that was searched, the number of favorites the tweet received, and lastly, the number of retweets the tweet received as well. All of these things will ultimately be uploaded to the database into the Tweets table as well. 


* What will 1 instance of this class represent?
1 instance of this class will represent one tweet containing the information searched for. 


* What are 3 instance variables this class will have? What will they be called, and what information will they hold? Why are they important?

3 instance variables this class will have are:
1. self.tweet, which will be a list that will hold all the information of the tweet, which is important as it is holding details that is vital to organizing our tweet information. 
2. self.movie_name, which will be a list that holds the information about the movie including movie name and actors. This will be important to keep this as its own list apart from the tweet information so we can cross it with the information from the Class Movie. 
3. self.


* Explain 2 methods the class will have that are not the class constructor (__init__ method) by answering the following questions for each. 
ONE METHOD:

2. movie_info, which will hold the movie information, including the name of the movie and the actors in it. This is important because this is ultimately the information that is most important to get into the database and vital to keep track of 

- What will the name of the method be?
tweet_deet

- What will the method do?
this method will compile a list of details about the tweet

- Will it take any additional input? 
just ‘self’

- Will it return anything? Should it change anything about the instance/an instance variable? 
this will return the list and will not change the instance variables.

- Why is it useful for this class definition, in this program?
This is useful for the class definition because it is organizing all of the tweet information right away and will make it easily accessible


ANOTHER METHOD:
- What will the name of the method be?
movie_info

- What will the method do?
compile a short list of the information about the movie that is in the tweet

- Will it take any additional input? 
just ‘self’

- Will it return anything? Should it change anything about the instance/an instance variable? 
This will return the list of keywords found in the tweet like an actor name and/or movie title and/or director.

- Why is it useful for this class definition, in this program?
In an attempt to gather all the information I can about the movies from a set of tweets, this list will help keep it all in order and make it easily accessible. 

[If you definitely want to have a third, feel free to answer those questions a third time, because you'll have to do so eventually. when you write documentation!]


* What will the tables in your database be?
The tables in my database will be the required: Tweets, Users, and Movies. 


* What fields will each database table have? Which field of them is the primary key? You should list the fields for each database table here, e.g.
Tweets:
- text, tweet ID (primary key), user, movie name, number of favorites, and number of retweets
Users:
- User ID (primary key), screen name, number of favorites (ever)
Movies:
- ID (primary key), title, director, number of languages, IMDB rating, top-billed


* List, in English, 2 queries you'll want to make from your database. At least one should be a JOIN. You can always change these later, but start with  ideas you're interested in and lessen the work on yourself later on! 
(e.g. from class examples, maybe "I want to make a query that accesses the numbers of times each user has favorited tweets, and the number of times tweets that user posted have been favorited -- so I'll be joining the Tweets table and the Users table")
I want to see how many favorites a user gets on a tweet mentioning one of the top actors, so I would join the Tweets table and the Movie table. 
I also want to see what the screen name of a user is that mentions a movie where there is a specific director, thus using join to combine the User and Movie table, and using WHERE to find a tweet with a specific director. 


* What are at least 2 of the data processing mechanics you're planning to use? 
I will use list comprehension and the zip function 


* Why will each of those be useful to you? What data might you use it on? 
(e.g. "Set comprehension: I think I'm going to be looking for unique names and proper nouns in this big set of text, so I'm going to use a set comprehension"). 
>>>This is especially important if you are doing Option 3, but it's important for everyone!<<<

I plan on using a list comprehension to compile the list of information I need from the tweets as this will be easily accessible when I just needs parts of the list. 
I also plan on using a zip mechanic to maybe put together a list of tweet information with information from the movie search to compile an overall tuple of the information and keywords we were looking for in the tweet. 



* What will your output look like? Will it be a .txt file? a CSV file? something else? What information will it contain? >>>This is especially important if you are doing Option 3, but it's important for everyone!<<<
My output will be a .txt file containing information about what kinds of tweets (positive or negative) are associated with a certain movie and a couple of the actors in that movie.
